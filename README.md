### 3. **Adding Code Snippets with Copy Option**
To add code snippets with the "copy" option for users, you can use the `fence` (code block) syntax in Markdown. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```markdown

// Inside an Activity
fun Activity.setStatusBarColor(colorResId: Int) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
        window.statusBarColor = ContextCompat.getColor(this, colorResId)

        // Set the light status bar flag for light colors
        if (isColorLight(ContextCompat.getColor(this, colorResId))) {
            window.decorView.systemUiVisibility = View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LIGHT_STATUS_BAR
        } else {
            window.decorView.systemUiVisibility = 0
        }
    }
}



// Try to open the document
binding.docview.openDoc(this, filePath, 3, -1, false, DocEngine.MICROSOFT)
